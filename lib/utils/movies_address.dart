      'Through the epic finale of Endgame (which essentially completed the first 3 phases of the MCU), there was a forward time jump of 5 years, placing most everything in Phase 4 and onward in the near future. Phase 4 started at the movies with Shang-Chi, and has been inviting its lineup of series to really do some heavy lifting, with Loki, Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Hawkeye pushing the story forward. Then there was the gigantic one-two Spider-Man punch with Far From Home and No Way Home. Moon Knight, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and now Thor: Love and Thunder are all set chronologically by release after that. And now, weâ€™ve added She-Hulk.';
